# odin-recipes

first project in the TOP curriculum that will make me understand the basics of HTML

before starting this project, i had 0 experience coding in HTML. hopefully i cook

edit: it took my like 1 hour to finish this project. i did three recipies and 100% imporved in coding each one. by the third one i learned about margins and br to add some space to make the website look better. overall im satisfied with my performance. 

what i wanna do next is make the link to go to each recipe a little better. i might add a pic and add a blur when hovering over it.
